= Installation =

Install ruby and ruby-dev beforehand if needed.

== Binary ==
{{{sh
mkdir ~/src
cd ~/src
wget http://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unix/vim-7.3.tar.bz2
tar -xaf vim-7.3.tar.bz2
cd vim73
./configure --with-features=huge --enable-perlinterp --enable-rubyinterp --enable-pythoninterp
make
make install
vim --version
}}}
--prefix={directory}  Top directory where to install Vim. Default is /usr/local

== Add plugins ==
* The NERD tree   : A tree explorer plugin for navigating the file system
* project.tar.gz  : Organize/Navigate projects of files (like IDE/buffer explorer) 
* !LustyExplorer  : Dynamic file system and buffer explorer # This plugin requires Vim be compiled with Ruby interpretation.
* !FuzzyFinder    : Buffer/file/command/tag/etc explorer with fuzzy matching 
* bufexplorer.zip : Buffer Explorer / Browser 
* taglist.vim     : Source code browser (supports C/C++, java, perl, python, tcl, sql, php, etc) 
* ack.vim         : Plugin for the Perl module / CLI script 'ack'

When a motion is not of the type you would like to use, you can force another
type by using "v", "V" or CTRL-V just after the operator.

== :jumps ==
A "jump" is one of the following commands: "'", "`", "G", "/", "?", "n",
"N", "%", "(", ")", "]]", "[[", "{", "}", ":s", ":tag", "L", "M", "H" and
the commands that start editing a new file.

Tip: last search is in register /. To copy it into command: <Ctrl-r>/. So firstly tune your search with inc-search and then copy it to g/<Ctrl-r/d

= Mapping and abbreviation =
{{{
map namp imap vmap map!
:map :vmap :map >               # show current mappings all/ for > only
:vumap > :unmap >               # unmap >
:vmap > >gv                     # indent block without losing selection
:vmap < <gv
:vmap <Tab> >gv
:vmap <S-Tab> <gv
:imap <Tab> <C-N>
:imap <S-Tab> <C-P>
:nnoremap ; :                   # swapping keys
:nnoremap : ;
:let mapleader=","              # change the personal hotkey
:imap <Leader>f <Esc>gUiw`]a    # capitalize current word in insert mode

:ab ff FireFox                  # insert, command and replace mode
}}}
To avoid the abbreviation in insert mode: Type part of the abbreviation, exit
insert mode with <Esc>, re-enter insert mode with "a" and type the rest.  Or
type CTRL-V before the character after the abbreviation.
To avoid the abbreviation in Command-line mode: Type CTRL-V twice somewhere in
the abbreviation to avoid it to be replaced.  A CTRL-V in front of a normal
character is mostly ignored otherwise.

= Foldings =
{{{

    indent  # indent
    syntax  # syntax highlighting rules
    marker  # markers in the text
    diff    # unchanged text (used in diff views)
    expr    # custom, code-driven folding
    manual  # select ranges to fold (default)
zM za (zc zo) zR     zk zj
}}}
= Text formating =

If vim knows the comment style of the file then if the next line in insert mode gets comment automatically

gq  # formates selected lines to the same length, sensitive to comments. Very useful

Often pasting text into vim from an external source screws up the formatting (especially tabs). To prevent this, do:

:set paste

Keeping this setting on screws up auto indentation while in insert mode, though. So to turn off, use

:set nopaste
