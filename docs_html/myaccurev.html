</pre><hr><pre>INSTALATION ON SUSE SP                                <b class="vimtag">*<a name="myaccurev-instalation">myaccurev-instalation</a>*</b>

Step-by-step instruction which probably will give you ability to compile the
code. All the steps below were done on VM with SUSE SP1 version. The parent
stream used in the examples are “upc-KHprep-cs”

1. Update VM.
# which update_vm
/re/bin/update_vm
# sudo update_vm
This will install necessary versions of gcc and libraries.

2. Update mount configuration needed for finding pre-generated rpms:
# sudo /c4shares/auto/devutils/bin/morpheus/c4dev_update.sh
<code class="note">NOTE:</code> This step is needed if you get complains about missing Artifacts
directory on later stages.

3. Install Accurev and CmTools. Instructions here:
https://teamforge6.usd.lab.emc.com/sf/go/wiki9520
<code class="note">NOTE:</code> recommended default path is /opt/accurev. List of the accurev servers
are in the howto.

4. Login to accurev
# accurev login -n <code class="special">&lt;your_user_name&gt;</code>
<code class="note">NOTE:</code> -n – creates the persistent login session with accurev and you do not
need to login every morning. Corp credentials.

5. Create a place where your workspace will be deployed on the VM.
# mkdir /c4_working/Coding/my_first_workspace
<code class="note">NOTE:</code> this is only a placeholder for files, call it as you want

6. Create a workspace
# accurev mkws -b upc-KHprep-cs -w bugfix  -l  /c4_working/Coding/my_first_workspace -i
<code class="note">NOTE:</code> -b - the name of parent scream.
-w - name of you workspace on server [you login will be added at the end].
-l - location.
-I - initialize new workspace
The workspace on the server will be visible as “bugfix_<code class="special">&lt;your_login_name&gt;</code>”

7. Initialize your new workspace.
#accurev update
<code class="note">NOTE:</code> you need to cd to the workspace.

8. Remove all the modules you will never need.
# modSetup -op remove all
<code class="note">NOTE:</code> this initially removes all the modules from the list - by default
everything in included - DP, CP, platform, kernel, images, drivers EVERYTHING.
You don’t want it all.

9. Set only modules that you will work on.
# modSetup -op set <code class="special">&lt;module_name&gt;</code>
<code class="note">NOTE:</code> to get the list of modules, run “modSetup -op list all”. Example of
modules: safe, cp, ECOM…

10. Populate workspace.
# modSetup -op pop
<code class="note">NOTE:</code> this will pull the files from the server for selected modules and place
them into you local workspace.

11. Update again.
# accurev update
<code class="note">NOTE:</code> I am not sure, but this will pull the dependencies for you modules. Does
not hurt anyway.

12. Build.
# build_all -t GNOSIS <code class="special">&lt;module_name&gt;</code>
<code class="note">NOTE:</code> you can give list all modules to build, comma separated, if you build
multiple. I build only “safe” module and it worked for me.

13. Find binaries and RPMs.
RPMs are placed in the output/<code class="special">&lt;module_name&gt;</code>/GNOSIS_DEBUG/
If you transfer selected libraries only,  search you module tree. For safe
they can be found under safe/Targets/armada64_checked/<code class="special">&lt;variation&gt;</code>/exec, where
variation is kernel/user/simulation and so on.
